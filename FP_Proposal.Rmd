# Project Title
**Assessing the Role of Personality in Drug Usage**

---

# Research Questions
Is there an association between the usage of illegal and legal drugs and a user’s personality, measured quantitatively through “approved” clinical scores?

---

# Motivation
Identifying which personality traits are associated with higher drug use can provide valuable insight for physicians, psychiatrists, and social workers in assessing patient risk and designing therapeutic interventions. Such understanding may improve both **clinical diagnostics** and **rehabilitation strategies**.  

Additionally, examining differences across **age, ethnicity, and country of origin**, as well as contrasting **legal** versus **illegal** drug use, can offer a broader view of the social and psychological patterns behind substance use behavior.

---

# Data Sources
We will use the **Drug Consumption** dataset from *Fehrman et al., 2015*, available via Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obeykhadija/drug-consumptions-uci](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obeykhadija/drug-consumptions-uci?resource=download)

This dataset includes **1,885 participants** with 12 quantified attributes:
- **Demographics:** age, gender, education, country, and ethnicity  
- **Personality measures:** OCEAN (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism), impulsivity, and sensation seeking  
- **Self-reported drug use:** 18 drugs (both legal and illegal)  

These features enable a comprehensive examination of how psychological traits relate to different types of substance use.

# Planned Analyses

### **Data Cleaning**
- Recode drug-use levels (CL0–CL6) as binary (User vs Non-user) and numeric (0–6) when relevant.  
- Categorize substances as **legal** (alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, chocolate) vs **illegal** (cannabis, cocaine, LSD, heroin, etc.).  
- Ensure consistent encoding and labeling of categorical variables.

### **Descriptive Summaries**
- Summarize demographics (age, gender, education, country) and personality traits (OCEAN, impulsivity, sensation seeking).  
- Present initial exploratory tables and distribution plots.

### **Statistical Analyses**
- **Chi-square tests**: assess associations between demographic factors (education, country) and drug-use status.  
- **ANOVA tests**: compare mean personality traits between users and non-users, and between legal vs illegal drug groups.  
- **Correlation analyses**: evaluate relationships between trait scores and quantitative consumption levels.

### **Visualizations**
- Histograms for OCEAN and impulsivity traits.  
- Boxplots of personality traits by user status.  
- Stacked bar charts comparing legal vs illegal drug use.  
- Heatmap of correlations between traits and drug-use levels.

### **Coding Challenges**
- Re-encoding 18 categorical variables consistently.  
- Balancing binary and ordinal outcomes.  
- Avoiding clutter in multi-variable plots.  
- Maintaining reproducibility and clear variable documentation.
