      <h2>Summary of Analyses</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Cannabis</strong></summary>
        <p>Cannabis use showed strong associations with education and country. Higher-education groups (Master’s, University, Professional diploma) had the highest usage, while early school-leavers used least. The USA and UK showed the highest usage rates.</p>
        <p>Personality differences were substantial: users scored higher in Openness and Neuroticism and lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Frequency of cannabis use was positively correlated with Openness and negatively with Conscientiousness and Agreeableness.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Nicotine</strong></summary>
        <p>Nicotine use was highest among respondents with partial college, professional certificates, or lower education, while those with advanced degrees used least. The USA and UK again exhibited strong usage patterns.</p>
        <p>Nicotine users had lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness and higher Neuroticism. Frequency of use reflected similar correlations: more frequent smokers showed lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness and higher Neuroticism.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Amphetamines</strong></summary>
        <p>Amphetamine use varied significantly by both education and country, with elevated use in the USA, UK, and Canada. Users tended to have university or partial college backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Amphetamine users showed the strongest personality separation: much higher Openness and Neuroticism and markedly lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. Usage frequency correlated positively with Openness and Neuroticism and negatively with Conscientiousness and Agreeableness.</p>
      </details>

      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>Across the three most-used substances—cannabis, nicotine, and amphetamines—consistent psychological patterns emerged. Openness was the strongest positive predictor of both likelihood and frequency of use, reflecting novelty-seeking and exploratory tendencies. Conscientiousness showed a robust negative relationship with use across all drugs, highlighting impulsivity or reduced behavioral inhibition.</p>
      <p>Neuroticism was particularly elevated among nicotine and amphetamine users and positively correlated with their usage frequency, suggesting affective vulnerability or coping-motivated use. Agreeableness showed steady negative associations with use and frequency, while Extraversion played a minimal role.</p>
      <p>Together, these findings indicate that substance use behaviors are shaped jointly by personality characteristics, educational background, and sociocultural context. While causation cannot be inferred, the consistency of effects across three drug classes highlights stable psychological profiles associated with experimentation and habitual use.</p>
