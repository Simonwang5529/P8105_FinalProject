    <h2>Usage Summary</h2>
    <p>The figure below summarizes the percentage of respondents who reported any use of each drug. Higher-prevalence substances (e.g., cannabis, nicotine) allow stronger inferential modeling, while extremely rare or almost universally used substances remain unsuitable for formal statistical comparisons.</p>

  <!-- SUMMARY OF ANALYSES -->
  <!-- ============================= -->
  <section class="glass pad">
    <h2>Summary of Analyses</h2>

    <!-- Cannabis -->
    <details open>
      <summary><strong>Cannabis</strong></summary>
      <p>Cannabis use showed strong associations with education and country. Higher-education groups (Master’s, University, Professional diploma) had the highest usage. The USA and UK showed the highest usage rates.</p>
      <p>Users scored higher in Openness and Neuroticism and lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Frequency of cannabis use was positively correlated with Openness and negatively with Conscientiousness and Agreeableness.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- Nicotine -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Nicotine</strong></summary>
      <p>Nicotine use was highest among respondents with partial college, professional certificates, or lower education, while those with advanced degrees used least. The USA and UK again exhibited strong usage patterns.</p>
      <p>Nicotine users had lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness and higher Neuroticism. Usage frequency showed similar correlations.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- Amphetamines -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Amphetamines</strong></summary>
      <p>Amphetamine use varied significantly by both education and country, with elevated use in the USA, UK, and Canada.</p>
      <p>Amphetamine users showed the strongest personality separation: much higher Openness and Neuroticism and markedly lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- Benzodiazepines -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong></summary>
      <p>Benzodiazepine users tended to have lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and higher Neuroticism. Usage varied by country, with the USA and UK displaying elevated prevalence.</p>
      <p>Frequency of benzo use correlated negatively with Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and positively with Neuroticism.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- Stimulants -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Stimulants (Cocaine + Methamphetamine)</strong></summary>
      <p>Stimulant use showed meaningful differences across education and country. Users tended to be less conscientious and less agreeable, with elevated Neuroticism and Openness.</p>
      <p>Usage frequency correlated strongly with Openness and Neuroticism.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- High Risk -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>High Risk (Heroin + Crack + VSA)</strong></summary>
      <p>Though less common overall, high-risk drug use displayed distinct patterns: users showed markedly lower Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, paired with substantially elevated Neuroticism.</p>
      <p>Usage was geographically clustered, with higher concentrations in the USA and UK.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- Psychedelics -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Psychedelics (LSD + Mushrooms + Ketamine + Ecstasy + Legal-H)</strong></summary>
      <p>Psychedelic users were more likely to have university-level education and reported higher Openness scores than non-users. Usage frequency correlated positively with Openness and Neuroticism and negatively with Conscientiousness.</p>
      <p>Country-level differences were also significant, with higher prevalence in North America and Europe.</p>

  <!-- INTERPRETATION -->
  <section class="glass pad">
    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>Across the analyzed substances—cannabis, nicotine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, stimulants, psychedelics, and high-risk drugs—consistent psychological themes emerged.</p>

    <p><strong>Openness</strong> was a strong positive predictor of both likelihood and frequency of use. <strong>Conscientiousness</strong> showed a robust negative relationship with use across nearly all categories. <strong>Neuroticism</strong> was especially elevated among stimulant, benzodiazepine, and high-risk users.</p>

    <p>Sociodemographic context (education level, country) also shaped usage patterns. While no causal claims can be made, the framework of personality × environment provides a coherent explanation for the observed patterns.</p>
