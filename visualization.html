      <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
      <p>
        Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) begins by transforming the cleaned Fehrman et&nbsp;al.
        dataset into several analysis-ready versions. We collapse the original seven-level
        CL0–CL6 drug-use scale into binary indicators of <strong>user vs. non-user</strong>, define
        a <strong>harmful user</strong> indicator that excludes caffeine and chocolate, and classify
        users as <strong>legal-only</strong> vs. <strong>illegal</strong> based on whether they report
        using drugs beyond alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, and nicotine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using these derived variables, we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tabulate the characteristics of the study sample.</li>
        <li>Visualize the distributions of the Big Five (OCEAN) personality scores, impulsivity, and sensation seeking.</li>
        <li>Compare personality scores between non-users and users (and harmful users) using boxplots.</li>
        <li>Examine how the proportion of legal vs. illegal users changes across levels of impulsivity and sensation seeking.</li>
        <li>Compute a correlation matrix between personality traits and ordinal drug-usage levels and display it as a heatmap.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the EDA suggests that while Big Five scores for users and non-users overlap substantially,
        higher <strong>sensation seeking</strong>, <strong>impulsivity</strong>, and <strong>openness</strong> are moderately associated
        with greater usage of several mostly illegal drugs (such as cannabis, legal highs, ecstasy, LSD, and mushrooms),
        whereas higher <strong>conscientiousness</strong> tends to be weakly associated with lower cannabis and legal-high usage.

  <h2>Summary of Visualization & Modeling Results</h2>

  <p>
    We first created a total drug consumption score for each participant by summing
    ordinal use levels across 18 drugs, and defined a binary “user / non-user”
    indicator for every substance. A chi-squared test comparing legal vs illegal
    drugs showed a strong association between drug type and consumption level:
    legal drugs (alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, etc.) are much more likely to be used
    at higher frequencies, while illegal drugs are concentrated at “never / very
    rare” levels.
  </p>

  <p>
    A linear regression using only the set of drugs a person uses predicts their
    log-transformed total consumption very well (adjusted R² ≈ 0.88). When we
    relate total use to personality traits, higher openness, neuroticism,
    impulsivity, and sensation seeking—and lower conscientiousness and
    agreeableness—are all associated with heavier drug use, whereas extraversion
    shows almost no association. Personality alone, however, explains only a
    modest fraction of the variability in total consumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then added environmental and demographic factors. Total consumption differs
    significantly by education, country, gender, ethnicity, and age. Higher risk
    is seen among people aged 18–24, those with “some college or university, no
    certificate or degree,” residents of the U.S., men, and several mixed/“other”
    ethnic groups. In contrast, participants from the U.K. and older age groups
    generally show lower consumption and more protective personality profiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our final “best” linear model combines key personality traits (O, C, N, and
    sensation seeking), education, age, gender, country, and selected
    interactions (including country–ethnicity). This model explains about half of
    the variation in total drug consumption (adjusted R² ≈ 0.51). Overall, our
    visualizations and models suggest that personality is important, but social
    and demographic context also plays a major role in shaping drug use patterns.
